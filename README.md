# Clinical Data Agent Architecture

## Overview
Data agent system leveraging LangGraph orchestration for both rules-based and predictive risk assessment. The system integrates LLM capabilities with clinical data processing to provide real-time insights and predictions.

## Architecture Documentation

The architecture consists of three main diagrams showing different aspects of the system:

### 1. Overall System Architecture

The overall architecture demonstrates how different components interact across layers:
- External Integration Layer
- LangGraph Orchestration
- Core Processing Layer
- Infrastructure Layer
- Storage Layer
- Monitoring Layer

### 2. Rules-Based Query Flow

Sequence diagram showing:
- Query processing flow
- Data retrieval and validation
- Rules application
- Results generation

### 3. Predictive Analysis Flow

Sequence diagram detailing:
- Predictive query handling
- Historical data processing
- ML model application
- Continuous learning loop

## Key Assumptions

### Clinical Domain
- Standard healthcare data formats (HL7, FHIR)
- HIPAA compliance requirements
- Clinical workflow integration needs
- Human-in-the-loop validation

### Technical Requirements
- High availability (99.9%)
- Sub-second query response
- Scalable to millions of records
- Secure data handling

### LLM Integration
- Open AI API access
- Vector storage capabilities
- RAG pipeline requirements
- Model performance expectations
