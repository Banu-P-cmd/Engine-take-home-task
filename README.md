## Entity & Domain Knowledge Complexities

### Entity Resolution Complexity

1. **Clinical Terms**
  - Same concept, multiple terms
    * "Blood sugar" = "Glucose" = "BG"
    * "HbA1c" = "A1c" = "Glycated hemoglobin"
  - Context-dependent meanings
    * "Normal" varies by test type
    * "High" depends on measurement context

2. **Standardization Challenges**
  - Multiple coding systems
    * Lab tests → LOINC
    * Diseases → ICD-10/SNOMED CT
    * Medications → RxNorm
  - Cross-mapping requirements
    * Converting between standards
    * Maintaining relationships
    * Version management

3. **Resolution Complexities**
  - Hierarchical relationships
    * "Diabetes" includes Type 1, Type 2, Gestational
  - Temporal aspects
    * Current vs historical terms
    * Changed medical definitions
  - Regional variations
    * UK vs US terminology
    * Local practice differences

### Domain Knowledge Complexity

1. **Clinical Rules**
  - Contextual interpretation
    * "High BP" varies by patient age
